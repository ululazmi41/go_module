# Go Tutorial - Create a Go Module

This repository serves as a practical exploration of Go's official tutorial, focusing on creating a module. The primary objective is to demonstrate the implementation of modules across separate files and directories. Specifically, the `hello/hello.go` module utilizes functionality from `greetings/greetings.go`.

Additionally, the repository also applies testing on the `greetings` module to ensure its functionality meets expectations.
